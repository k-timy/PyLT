# PyTorch Supermask
The implementation of Supermask training in PyTorch. I have posted [a more detailed explanation of this project on medium and published in Towards AI](https://https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/supermasks-a-simple-introduction-and-implementation-in-pytorch-a80cd9f1f0a6?source=---------2------------------).

This project is based upon the paper:
[**Deconstructing Lottery Tickets: Zeros, Signs, and the Supermask**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01067 from Uber AI labs) and their original source code written in TensorFlow [available on github.](https://github.com/uber-research/deconstructing-lottery-tickets)
